              The weather website called MinWeather was created with two main
              goals: to learn how to use APIs effectively and to improve my
              JavaScript skills. APIs play a crucial role in web development and
              other applications, so the primary focus of this project was to
              gain experiance in working with them. By actively using APIs in
              MinWeather, I was able learn how to integrate external data
              sources, retrieve real-time weather information, and present it in
              a user-friendly way.
              <br />
              <br />
              Additionally, JavaScript is a fundamental language in web
              development, offering dynamic and interactive features. MinWeather
              provided a practical environment to expand knowledge and
              proficiency in JavaScript. By writing JavaScript code for the
              website, I had had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of
              the language, explore its various features.
              <br />
              <br />
              In summary, MinWeather served as a platform to display weather in
              a simple manner but also for me to learn about APIs and improve my
              JavaScript skills. It provided hands-on experience in API
              integration and offered a practical setting to explore the
              functionalities of JavaScript. By accomplishing these objectives,
              I gained my confidence and abilities to tackle more complex web
              development projects.
